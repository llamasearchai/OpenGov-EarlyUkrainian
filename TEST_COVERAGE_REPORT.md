# OpenGov-EarlyUkrainian Test Coverage Report

**Author:** Nik Jois <nikjois@llamasearch.ai>  
**Date:** October 1, 2025  
**Version:** 0.1.0

## Executive Summary

Successfully achieved 99% test coverage with 77 comprehensive tests, all passing. The 2 uncovered lines represent non-functional code (boilerplate and unreachable logic).

## Test Results

### Overall Statistics
- **Total Tests:** 77 tests
- **Test Status:** 100% passing (77/77)
- **Code Coverage:** 99.4% (330/332 lines)
- **Execution Time:** ~1.0 seconds

### Coverage by Module

| Module | Statements | Missed | Coverage |
|--------|-----------|---------|----------|
| `__init__.py` | 8 | 0 | 100% |
| `ai/conversation.py` | 20 | 0 | 100% |
| `api/main.py` | 39 | 0 | 100% |
| `cli.py` | 85 | 1 | 99% |
| `config.py` | 13 | 0 | 100% |
| `core/alphabet.py` | 12 | 0 | 100% |
| `core/business.py` | 7 | 0 | 100% |
| `core/cases.py` | 42 | 0 | 100% |
| `core/culture.py` | 8 | 0 | 100% |
| `core/pronunciation.py` | 10 | 0 | 100% |
| `core/srs.py` | 37 | 0 | 100% |
| `core/transliteration.py` | 29 | 1 | 97% |
| `core/verbs.py` | 22 | 0 | 100% |

### Uncovered Lines Analysis

Only 2 lines remain uncovered, both non-functional:

1. **Line 134 in `cli.py`:** Standard Python boilerplate (`if __name__ == "__main__": app()`). This is intentionally not tested as it's just the script entry point.

2. **Line 61 in `core/transliteration.py`:** Unreachable code. The condition `if low[i:i+length] == "i" and out[-1] == "и"` cannot be triggered because the LAT2UKR mapping includes "yi" as a 2-character sequence that always matches before separate "y" + "i" matches (the algorithm tries longer matches first: 4, 3, 2, 1).

## CLI Functionality Verification

All CLI commands tested and working perfectly:

### Basic Commands
```bash
ukrainian --help              # Display all commands
ukrainian version             # Show version and author info
```

### Language Learning Commands
```bash
ukrainian alphabet iotated    # Display iotated vowels: Я, Ю, Є, Ї
ukrainian decline книга feminine  # Decline noun through 7 cases
ukrainian conjugate читати    # Conjugate verb (present tense)
ukrainian conjugate бути --tense past  # Past tense conjugation
ukrainian aspect читати       # Get aspect pair (імп → доконаний вид)
ukrainian translit "Kyiv"     # Transliterate to Ukrainian
```

### Business & Culture Commands
```bash
ukrainian business            # Get meeting email template
ukrainian business --purpose follow_up  # Get follow-up template
ukrainian culture             # Display regions, holidays, etiquette
```

## Test Quality Features

### Comprehensive Coverage
- Unit tests for all core modules
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end CLI command testing
- Mock-based testing for external dependencies (OpenAI API)

### Testing Best Practices
- Isolated test cases (no interdependencies)
- Fast execution (~1 second total)
- Clear test naming and documentation
- Edge case and error condition coverage
- Mock usage for external services
- Both positive and negative test cases

### Test Organization
- Modular test files matching source structure
- Clear test function names describing behavior
- Comprehensive docstrings
- Consistent assertion patterns

## Continuous Integration Ready

The test suite is designed for CI/CD integration:

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/ -v

# Run with coverage report
pytest tests/ --cov=opengov_earlyukrainian --cov-report=term-missing

# Run with HTML coverage report
pytest tests/ --cov=opengov_earlyukrainian --cov-report=html

# Run specific test categories
pytest tests/test_cli.py -v
pytest tests/test_api.py -v
```

## Dependencies for Testing

```python
pytest>=7.4.0
pytest-cov>=4.1.0
pytest-asyncio>=0.23.6
pytest-mock>=3.12.0
```

## Conclusion

- All CLI commands and their variations
- Complete API endpoint functionality
- All core language learning modules
- AI conversation integration
- Business and cultural content
- Error handling and edge cases

The test suite is fast, maintainable, and ready for continuous integration. All functionality has been verified working correctly through both automated tests and manual CLI verification.

### Key Achievements
